//! The **single engine task**: the one place all query execution is funnelled, owning the
//! [`graphus_storage::RecordStore`] + [`graphus_cypher::TxnCoordinator`]
//! (`04-technical-design.md` §9.1 sharded write/ACID path, v1 = one shard; §1.3 request lifecycle).
//!
//! ## Why a single task on a dedicated thread
//!
//! The cypher engine is **single-threaded** (`!Sync`, `Rc<RefCell<…>>`-backed). The server is a
//! multi-threaded Tokio runtime. Rather than wrap the coordinator in a lock (which would serialise
//! anyway and risk holding a guard across `.await`), we run it on **one dedicated OS thread** and
//! serve [`EngineCommand`]s over a **bounded** `std::sync::mpsc` channel ([`EngineHandle`]). The
//! engine executes each command serially against the coordinator and streams result rows back over a
//! bounded channel ([`stream`]). This is the §9.1 "small set of shards" model with one shard, and
//! the single-node single-writer ACID core. The thread is **not** a Tokio worker, so the
//! coordinator's blocking work (storage I/O, the WAL group-commit `fdatasync`) runs off the runtime
//! exactly as §9.1 requires.
//!
//! ## Transactions
//!
//! Connections refer to transactions by an opaque [`TxTicket`] the engine mints. An explicit
//! transaction (`BEGIN … COMMIT`) is driven by the connection. An **auto-commit** statement opens an
//! internal transaction, runs, and the engine commits it **when the result stream is fully drained**
//! (so the side effects and the streamed rows agree). Read serialisation through the engine is the
//! v1 behaviour; lock-free concurrent reads against committed versions are the documented follow-up
//! (§9.1).

/// ## Unwind-safety justification (the load-bearing reasoning)
///
/// The closure captures `&mut TxnCoordinator` (and the open-tx map), which is `!UnwindSafe` because
/// the coordinator transitively holds `Rc<RefCell<…>>`. [`AssertUnwindSafe`] is sound here because we
/// **do not** observe any partially-mutated state across the boundary: on a caught panic we run
/// [`rollback_panicked_statement`], which calls [`TxnCoordinator::rollback`] (→ ARIES
/// `store.abort_writer` / `rollback`) on the statement's transaction, discarding the entire
/// half-applied write buffer and **restoring the durable store state via ARIES undo** regardless of
/// *where* mid-write the panic struck. No `RefCell` is left borrowed: the per-statement seam
/// ([`RecordStoreGraph`]) borrows the store only transiently *inside* each operation via RAII guards,
/// so unwinding drops every live `Ref`/`RefMut` before this frame regains control. No lock is poisoned
/// either: the coordinator's shared state lives behind `Rc<RefCell>` (single-thread, no `Mutex`), and
/// the rollback is the explicit recovery. The transaction is therefore left *rolled back*, never
/// half-applied.
///
/// ## What the rollback does and does NOT undo (`rmp` #410 — be precise)
///
/// [`coordinator::abort`](TxnCoordinator) rolls back the **durable store** (ARIES undo of the write
/// buffer) but does **not** undo the in-memory derived secondary indexes. Two index shapes behave
/// differently:
///
/// * **Insert-only candidate indexes** (the node-property index the planner actually uses) are
///   *candidate sources* reconciled by the executor's **query-time re-check** against the MVCC store,
///   so a stale entry left by an aborted write is dropped at read time — safe.
/// * **Membership-exact indexes** (bitmap, full-text, spatial) maintain themselves with a
///   *remove-then-reinsert* on a property change (`record_graph.rs`, `index_set.rs`, `fulltext.rs`),
///   so a panic *between* the remove and the reinsert could leave a committed node's entry **missing**.
///   This is **not** abort-undone today and is safe only because: (1) the **bitmap** index is not yet
///   wired into the planner (test-only consumers — see the warning at its seek consumers in
///   `index_set.rs`), so a missing bitmap entry is never read on a production plan; and (2) full-text /
///   spatial maintenance reaches that window only on allocation failure, which **aborts** (it does not
///   `panic`/unwind), so no production-reachable unwind strikes mid-reinsert. **Wiring bitmap into the
///   planner — or making membership-exact maintenance able to panic — requires either abort-undo of the
///   in-memory index or a dedicated panic-window regression test first.**
